### SAFe Agile Roadmap
```

### Iteration 1 (Q1 2025): Core Platform & Pilot
- **Objective**: Deploy AI model to pilot smelter line, gather feedback.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Basic real-time detection with YOLOv8
  - API endpoint + JWT auth
  - Data pipeline for stable training
- **Metrics**:
  - 80% model accuracy in pilot
  - <100ms inference on edge

### Iteration 2 (Q2 2025): Scale & Edge Optimization
- **Objective**: Optimize for Jetson devices, expand to 2â€“3 lines.
- **Deliverables**:
  - TensorRT build
  - Enhanced training with synthetic data
- **Metrics**:
  - 90% detection accuracy
  - <5ms latency on Jetson

### Iteration 3 (Q3 2025): Multi-Plant Rollout
- **Objective**: Deploy to 20 global plants, unify dashboards.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Central monitoring
  - Automated drift detection & retraining
- **Metrics**:
  - 95% overall accuracy
  - 50% reduction in manual QA costs
  - >$90M annual ROI

### Adaptations & Feedback Loops
- End-of-iteration demos, cross-functional reviews (Product, QA, Ops).
- Data-driven pivot if new defect types or major compliance changes arise.

### Agile Data Workstreams

- **Backlog Management**: Stories related to data governance, cataloging, and advanced analytics are captured as separate epics.
- **Scrum Master Collaboration**: The Scrum Master ensures data tasks are prioritized alongside traditional dev tasks, aligning with business objectives.
- **Cross-Functional Sync**: Weekly standups involve data scientists, data engineers, solution architects, and product owners to ensure alignment.
