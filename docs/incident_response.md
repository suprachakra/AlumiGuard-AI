# Incident Response

## Scope
- Security breaches
- Major system outages
- Significant misdetections impacting production

## Steps
1. **Detect**: Alert from monitoring or staff
2. **Contain**: Isolate affected microservices or nodes
3. **Eradicate**: Patch vulnerabilities or revert to stable model
4. **Recover**: Restore normal operations, validate system health
5. **Review**: Post-mortem analysis, documentation of root cause

## Escalation Path
- Tier 1: On-call engineer
- Tier 2: Security & DevOps leads
- Tier 3: Executive team if major breach or downtime
