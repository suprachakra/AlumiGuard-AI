# UI/UX Design

## Vision
A user-friendly interface for QA inspectors & operators, focusing on speed, clarity, and minimal training.

## Core Design Principles
- **High Contrast**: For factory lighting conditions
- **Large Icons & Text**: Operators wearing gloves or with partial visibility
- **Color Coding**: Severity-based bounding boxes (Red=High, Orange=Medium, Green=Low)

## User Flows
1. **Login** -> **Upload Image** -> **View Defects** -> **Flag or Approve** -> **Close Session**
2. **Batch Mode**: Bulk upload -> Summarized defect report -> Export to PDF/ERP

## Prototypes
- Wireframes in Figma (link or attachments)
- Focus on minimal clicks for routine tasks
